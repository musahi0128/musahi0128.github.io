This shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be a security concern since only you can access the server.

One way to do it is running a VNC server.\nVNC stands for Virtual Network Computing, a graphical desktop-sharing system that uses the Remote Frame Buffer protocol (RFB) to remotely control another computer. It transmits the keyboard and mouse input from one computer to another, relaying the graphical-screen updates, over a network. Read more here.\nI will demonstrate how to setup a VNC server using tigervnc package. This is tested on fresh install of Ubuntu 24.04.1 LTS running on LXD container.\nSetting up # Update list of available packages sudo apt update # Install required packages sudo apt install tigervnc-standalone-server tigervnc-xorg-extension Once the packages installed, you need to set a password for the vncserver by running vncpasswd command on your terminal.\n$ vncpasswd Password: Verify: Would you like to enter a view-only password (y/n)? When you type in the password, it will show nothing, so proceed with caution. If you want to share the screen later with somebody else and let them only view the display, you can say y when offered to put in the view-only password.\ntigervnc password can only hold 8 characters. You can type in as many characters as you like and it will not warn you, but then it will be truncated to the first 8 characters.\nAfter the password is set, you can then run vncserver -localhost=0. By default it will run in the background, set the server for display :1 and accept only connection from localhost. The -localhost=0 switch make sure it also accept connection coming from outside of localhost. Otherwise, you will only able to connect to it while having SSH session, do a port mapping to the vnc server port and connect to the mapped port on your own host.\nNext, you can run a graphical application or desktop environment by adding DISPLAY=:1 before the command.\nFor example, to run xeyes (part of x11-apps package), you can type DISPLAY=:1 xeyes on your terminal.\nAnother way to run application on the vnc server is to include it in the vncserver command. The above example can be run using this command when starting up the vnc server: vncserver -localhost=0 -- xeyes.\nAccess Access the virtual display using a vnc client.\nTightVNC Viewer, available as part of TightVNC server installation on Windows Remmina on Linux Apple Remote Desktop or RealVNC on Mac OS. I don\u0026rsquo;t have Mac so this is not tested. The vnc client will ask you for the address of the server. You should be able to find it using ip addr command.\n$ ip addr 1: lo: \u0026lt;LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP\u0026gt; mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN group default qlen 1000 link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00 inet 127.0.0.1/8 scope host lo valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever inet 10.255.255.254/32 brd 10.255.255.254 scope global lo valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever inet6 ::1/128 scope host valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever 2: eth0: \u0026lt;BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP\u0026gt; mtu 1492 qdisc mq state UP group default qlen 1000 link/ether 00:15:5d:46:04:ca brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff inet 172.25.155.116/20 brd 172.25.159.255 scope global eth0 valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever inet6 fe80::215:5dff:fe46:4ca/64 scope link valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever On the output above, the address of the server is 172.25.155.116. You can put 172.25.155.116:5901 on the address input of the vnc client apps.\n","date":"December 9, 2024","hero":"/images/posts/tigervnc.svg","permalink":"https://musahi0128.github.io/posts/ubuntu/vncserver_headless/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eSorry for the tiger eye staring at you.
