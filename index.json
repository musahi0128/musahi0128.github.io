This will prepare your working directory with required files.\nRun terraform plan -var-file='main.tfvars' to see what action Terraform will took and what resources will be provisioned. Check if the would-be provisioned resource conform to the free offer limitation.\nIf the output contains no error, run terraform apply -var-file='main.tfvars'. It will ask you for confirmation, answer with yes.\nThe public_ip_address output would be empty and this is a know issue as the time of writing. You can either check directly on Azure portal or run terraform refresh -var-file='main.tfvars' to get it populated.\nOnce all the steps has been completed, you can connect to the VM using ssh command.\nDemo Following video demonstrate the workflow above starting from step #5. Do let me know in the comment if you need a walkthrough for step 1-4. Additionally, it also shows how the VM can be connected remotely from anywhere via its public ip.\nAdditional note Using an SSH private/public key pair is highly recommended for enhanced security when working with Linux VMs. SSH keys feature in Azure is there to handle this needs. However, this step is being omitted here to stay within the scope of this post.

Click on your Subscription name. Under Top free services by usage section, click on View all free services button. With the free offer, you can provision following VM without additional charge:\nFree account\u0026rsquo;s virtual machine (Windows) Free account\u0026rsquo;s virtual machine (Linux) You might want to provision the VM manually to have more control. For instance, you want to use the latest Ubuntu Noble image instead of Ubuntu Jammie which you will get by provisioning the VM using the URL above. However, using the default option when manually provisioning the VM will likely result in additional charges.\nTo make sure the VM uses the free offers, following details needs to be specified:\nBasics Availability options: No infrastructure redundancy required Size: Standard_B1s - 1 vcpu, 1 GiB memory ($7.59/month) (free services eligible) Disks OS disk size: 64 GiB (P6) OS disk type: Premium SSD (locally-redundant storage) Networking Public IP: Create new with SKU: Basic and Assignment: Dynamic I lost access to my free subscription benefits somehow, and now I\u0026rsquo;m on Pay-as-you-go subscription. Fortunately, the free offer still remains and those configs help me avoid additional charges.\nDetails Basic Availability options I\u0026rsquo;m not so sure myself about this one, but when selecting options other than No infrastructure redundancy required, I get the impression that multiple VM will be provisioned or may allocate additional resources (e.g., replication for high availability), which exceed the free offer.\nSize The free offer listed following size:\nVirtual Machines, Basv2 Series Windows, B2ats v2 Virtual Machines, Basv2 Series, B2ats v2 Virtual Machines, Bpsv2 Series Windows, B2pts v2 Virtual Machines, Bpsv2 Series, B2pts v2 Virtual Machines, BS Series Windows, B1s Virtual Machines, BS Series, B1s However:\nB2ats and B2pts require 2 vCPUs, and the message when trying to select those size are Insufficient quota and Family vCPUs are insufficient to deploy these sizes. When doing provisioning manually, all Windows image required at least 127 GiB on the OS disk size, so it won\u0026rsquo;t be covered by the free offer. So Standard_B1s, which giving you 1 vCPU and 1 GiB memory, is the only option if you want to use the free offer. Unless provisioned using the URL mentioned on the summary of this post, or via Terraform (check out this post), you can only manually provision a Linux VM due to disk size constraints.\nThe free offer\u0026rsquo;s usage/limit was 750 (1 Hour), meaning you can have one VM running a month for free. If you provision two VMs, then both can run for around half of a month before incurring additional charges. And so on and so forth. Please note that this scenario would work and stays within the free offer if you use only one public IP.\nDisk Both of OS disk size (64 GiB (P6)) and type (Premium SSD (locally-redundant storage)) need to match exactly, as the meter says Storage, Premium Page Blob, P6 Disks.\nNetworking Networking, Public IP Addresses, IP Address Hours listed on the free services page entitled you to one public ip with Basic SKU and Dynamic address assignment.\nUsing Standard SKU, be it static or dynamic address assignment; or Basic SKU with static address assignment, would still cost you to run the VM. It would even incurring additional charges when the VM is not running, as the address is taken from the pool and allocated indefinitely to your subscription until the public ip is released.\nUsage checking Usage on your Free services for 12 months will start to appear the next day.

But let\u0026rsquo;s says it isn\u0026rsquo;t an option for you, or you don\u0026rsquo;t want to do it that way for any reason.\nOne way to solve this problem is to setup SSH connection between the server and the monitored hosts, and then forward the Zabbix agent port (10050 by default) of the monitored host to a port on the server. This would work if your Zabbix server is accessible by its public IP and able to expose its SSH port. Refer to this post on how to setup Zabbix server on a machine with ARM64/AArch64 processor and Ubuntu Noble operating system.\nSSH client are available on Linux, Mac OS, and even on the lates version of Windows by default, so this would be a cross-platform solution.\nWe will harden the SSH installation on the server, and setup a user with no ability other than what is required to allow the port forwarding to happens. Those steps are required to reduce cyber security attack surface.\nSetting up On the server Harden SSH service config For starter, you can add or adjust following lines on your /etc/ssh/sshd_config\nProtocol 2 # Use only the secure SSH protocol version 2.

If you want to share the screen later with somebody else and let them only view the display, you can say y when offered to put in the view-only password.\ntigervnc password can only hold 8 characters. You can type in as many characters as you like and it will not warn you, but then it will be truncated to the first 8 characters.\nAfter the password is set, you can then run vncserver -localhost=0. By default it will run in the background, set the server for display :1 and accept only connection from localhost. The -localhost=0 switch make sure it also accept connection coming from outside of localhost. Otherwise, you will only able to connect to it while having SSH session, do a port mapping to the vnc server port and connect to the mapped port on your own host.\nNext, you can run a graphical application or desktop environment by adding DISPLAY=:1 before the command.\nFor example, to run xeyes (part of x11-apps package), you can type DISPLAY=:1 xeyes on your terminal.\nAnother way to run application on the vnc server is to include it in the vncserver command. The above example can be run using this command when starting up the vnc server: vncserver -localhost=0 -- xeyes.\nAccess Access the virtual display using a vnc client.\nTightVNC Viewer, available as part of TightVNC server installation on Windows Remmina on Linux Apple Remote Desktop or RealVNC on Mac OS. I don\u0026rsquo;t have Mac so this is not tested. The vnc client will ask you for the address of the server. You should be able to find it using ip addr command.\n$ ip addr 1: lo: \u0026lt;LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP\u0026gt; mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN group default qlen 1000 link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00 inet 127.0.0.1/8 scope host lo valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever inet 10.255.255.254/32 brd 10.255.255.254 scope global lo valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever inet6 ::1/128 scope host valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever 2: eth0: \u0026lt;BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP\u0026gt; mtu 1492 qdisc mq state UP group default qlen 1000 link/ether 00:15:5d:46:04:ca brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff inet 172.25.155.116/20 brd 172.25.159.255 scope global eth0 valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever inet6 fe80::215:5dff:fe46:4ca/64 scope link valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever On the output above, the address of the server is 172.25.155.116. You can put 172.25.155.116:5901 on the address input of the vnc client apps.\n","date":"December 9, 2024","hero":"/images/posts/tigervnc.svg","permalink":"https://musahi0128.github.io/posts/os/ubuntu/vncserver_headless/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eSorry for the tiger eye staring at you.
